					        About me (Brendan): For the last couple of years I've made a living as a freelancer (a 'portfolio' career). I split my time between working on an ongoing casual basis with a couple of NGO's (FYA/YLab being one where I've been handed the title of 'Technical Advisor'); and I run a design lab called 'Little Sketches' where I practice strategic design and visualisation, pretty much exclusively in the areas of environmental and social sustainability. I also tinker a lot with web technologies and data science. 
					        Previously, I spent dozen years in strategy and technology consulting, investment management, but mostly as a sustainability consultant (main passion). 

					        I've been getting serious about data visualisation for around five years - studying and tinkering, and getting into the 'community' to play at edges of visual design and the technologies that support them - but looking back the work I've done more than 10 years ago, it should have been pretty apparent I neede to move out of Excel.

			    		<aside class="notes">
				       		This is a brief selection of 'stuff' I was making with Excel. Pretty much all of this sat on top of large models and datasets: acting as both an entry point and summary of the output. Something that I learned through practice is that if you want a nice visualisation of data to 'communicate' meaning, you need to do a lot of work to prepare your data and explain to your audience what your message is. For a static chart this might simply be setting the axes, design a good key or legend, and adding clear labels and headings. But as the dataset becomes more complex - starting with multiple charts and views, then moving more and more into interactive components, then data stories - the complexity of designing a everything but the visualization amplifies very quickly.  

				       		We'll also see that visualisation is both a tool for exploring data, and explanation. More on that later.

			    		Yes, the same Florence Nightingale. Nightingale used this 'rose' chart to deomnstrate the huge losses through preventable diesease, which contributed to the strategy to regulalry replace troops to prevent the spread of disease on teh frontline.
			    		Here the blue outer wedges represent the deaths from contagious diseases, such as cholera and typhus. The central red wedges show the deaths from wounds. The black wedges in between represent deaths from all other causes. If this rate had continued, and troops had not been replaced frequently, then disease alone would have killed the entire British Army in the Crimea. Nightingale's graph not only dramatised the extent of the needless deaths among the soldiers during the Crimean War, but it was used as a tool to persuade the government and medical profession that deaths were preventable if sanitation reforms were implemented in military and civilian hospitals.

						<p><em><small>These are very different types of visualisations that have very different audiences</small></em></p>
   						<aside class="notes">
			    		 Exploratory visualisations are used in analysis to search for patterns, trends and anomalies: they help use look for interesting stories in the data and do not need to be 'polished'. Explanatory visulisations are more narrative based and are intended to inform and enlighten an audience that may not be familiar with the data or topic. Data journalism pieces are prime examples of explanatory visualisations.
