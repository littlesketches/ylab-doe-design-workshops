					        About me (Brendan): For the last couple of years I've made a living as a freelancer (a 'portfolio' career). I split my time between working on an ongoing casual basis with a couple of NGO's (FYA/YLab being one where I've been handed the title of 'Technical Advisor'); and I run a design lab called 'Little Sketches' where I practice strategic design and visualisation, pretty much exclusively in the areas of environmental and social sustainability. I also tinker a lot with web technologies and data science. 
					        
					        When it comes to the web I'm as much of a consumer as anyone: with my 'maker' knowledge more akin to an interaction designer (but I can code, and I do develop and manage web apps and websites). I'm also particularly fascinated by cognition and the peculiarities of human behaviours - so this training is littered with lessons based in psychology and behavioural economics.

			    		<aside class="notes">
			    		- Characteristics and terms are debated between what we generally consider "Web 1.0" (the early web) and where we are now. However what does characterise Web 2.0 is the move from publishing (many blogs and personal pages) to participation. Social networking sites - where user generated content rules - are dominant players on the Internet, and they are changing the way we both access and interact with other pages. Content like podcasts, blogs and tags are also a major part of Web 2.0.
			    		- The web browser as a platform for apps is an equally distinct characteristic of what we know call web 2.0. 
			    		- Also note that Tim Berners-Lee is critical of the term (this was his intention for the web all along)

			    		<aside class="notes">
			    		 We'll contend that that usability (function) and emotional design (understanding psychology) are 'timeless' principles to use in web design. Our plan today is to think about designing an 'experience' from a brief understanding the nuts and bolts of a web page and the mediums that its consumed on, to the more emotive design considerations that play on the human psyche.

			    		CMS's are interface to make life easier if you want to build a website without having to code. Most organisations hire a developer or agency to build their site, or they do it themselves without any technical knowledge, making a CMS very attractive (since everything is much easier to update). However be warned that to tweak things exactly the way you want it, you still might need to understand a bit of code a little.
			    		Between pure HTML and the CMS option, there are also 'frameworks' like Bootstrap and Boilerplate, and (JavaScript) libraries that allow you to code HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but help to control basic layout functions and formatting (e.g. for say responsive design.)

			    		Norman cites evolutionary biology and what we know about how our brains work. Basically, when we are relaxed, our brains are more flexible and more likely to find workarounds for difficult problems. In contrast, when we’re frustrated and tense, our brains get a sort of tunnel vision where we only see the problem in front of us

						According to a 2002 study out of Stanford university, it is the “appeal of the overall visual design of a site, including layout, typography, font size, and color schemes,” (Fogg, et al., 2002).  e look and feel of a site influenced judgments about credibility far more than other factors like structure, usefulness of the information, tone of the content, and name recognition<

						First impressions count (as little as 50ms)
						
			    		Emotional Design: the ATM example

			    		CHI 2007 conference paper (cf ANderson, 2013) users were asked to “judge the relevancy of identical search results from different search engines. “Participants in the study indicated that the results from Google and Yahoo were superior to identical results found through Windows live or a generic search engine.” 

			    		In one study, described in the article “a blessing, not a Curse: experimental evidence for beneficial effects of Visual aesthetics on Performance” (Moshagen, 2009), volunteers completed a series of search tasks on a site that provided health-related information. “Four versions of a website were created by manipulating visual aesthetics (high vs. low) and usability (good vs. poor)”  e results? Good visual aesthetics did compensate for poor usability, improving task completion time, and reducing errors.

			    		“We Influence of Design aesthetics in usability testing: effects on user Performance and Perceived usability,” (Sonderegger and Sauer, 2009), presented adolescents with one of two mobile phones, an attractive one, and one less so.  The conclusion?
						“The visual appearance of the phone had a positive effect on performance, leading to reduced task completion times for the attractive model.”

			    		<aside class="notes">
			    		Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi  idea of “flow.” flow is defined as “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoy- able that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.” this is discussed in Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, 1990, by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
						Goals. “Site designers assume that the visitor already knows what to choose. that’s not true. People enter hoping to be led somewhere, hoping for a payoff.”
						Feedback. “Most Web sites don’t very much care what you do. it would be much better if they said, ‘You’ve made some interesting choices.’”
						Challenge. “A flow experience has got to be challenging. Anything that is not up to par is going to be irritating or ignored.”
						Progression. “You need clear goals that fit into a hierarchy, with little goals that build toward more meaningful, higher-level goals.”

						[Flow is] being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you’re using your skills to the utmost.

			    		In one study by Dan Ariely, students were asked to write the last two digits of their social security number. with this number in front of them, Ariely asked if they would pay this amount for items whose value they did not know (wine, chocolate, and computer equipment).  They were then asked to submit a bid for these items.  Thee results?  Those audience members with higher two-digit numbers placed bids that were “between 60 percent and 120 percent more” than those students with the lower social security numbers. we’re great at setting relative values, but terrible at placing an absolute value on something. An obvious example of this comes in the form of charities that set a range of options from which to choose. If the options are something like $5, $10, $25, and $50, we’re going to donate much less than if the options start at $50 and go up to $5,000.  These anchors give us a cue from which we can adjust our assessment
