					        About me (Brendan): For the last couple of years I've made a living as a freelancer (a 'portfolio' career). I split my time between working on an ongoing casual basis with a couple of NGO's (FYA/YLab being one where I've been handed the title of 'Technical Advisor'); and I run a design lab called 'Little Sketches' where I practice strategic design and visualisation, pretty much exclusively in the areas of environmental and social sustainability. I also tinker a lot with web technologies and data science. 

					        Previously, I spent dozen years in strategy and technology consulting, investment management, but mostly as a sustainability consultant (main passion). I came to design initially through information and data design (trying to make models more digestible), then through digital and graphic design (using the web, and understanding form and tell visual stories), and then through strategic design 'thinking' (on a mission to rethink what I do from a systemic and innovation lens). I'm currently most fascinated with speculative and relational design theory (getting 'meta') and the how to weave design with data science to scale social change.

						<h4>Thought #1</h4>
						<h3>all <span class = "red">good design</span> is human centered</h3>
			    		
			    		<aside class="notes">
					        The methods and processed you'll learn in Design Thinking, Human Centered Design, User Centered Design etc. are not new to 'designers'. These processes are a great introduction to how designers think (or are taught); but try to think of them as just that. Design is by nature, chaotic. Letting yourself embrace that chaos is half the challenge. And try not to be overly rigid with the process.

						<h4>Thought #2</h4>
						<h3><span class = "red">Not</span><span> every complex problem requires design thinking.</span></h3>
			    		
			    		<aside class="notes">
					        If you go to enough design thinking or HCD courses you might get the impression that every challenge can and should be solved by design. I'd argue that this is not always correct. There are expert driven solutions and advances - particularly in areas like technology, engineering, energy, academia, medicine and business - that don't benefit greatly from design. There are certainly common mindsets and tools that you'll see repeated in design, but they are also native to other disciplines.
					        <br>
					        Try not to think of design a magic bullet for problem solving and innovation. Think of it as a set of tools that work well together. And if the process seems 'obvious' to you, or if its what you already do, then that's great. It's meant to be human.
					        <br>
					        Jeanne Liedtke course in Design for Business Innovation is a good example a well balanced view to when to use design: https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-thinking-innovation

							We'll look at these concepts in the context of design because they are somewhat 'extreme'. Ethnography is possibly in-depth way to gain empathy for someone. It's very human. Data (science) on the other hand has a reputation of being un-human. By looking at these concepts together we might weave a broader net for innovation, which has become synonymous with the language of design.

						<p>Gaining insight from fieldwork and <span class = "red">observation</span>.</p>
					    <aside class="notes">
					        Observation is sometimes neglected in favour of more 'market' research methods (interviews, focus groups etc.).Why? Because the formal application is hard to do. It takes a lot of time and resources. It doesn't scale (and its not meant to). Market research methods include techniques like surveys, structured interviews, and focus groups. They tend to be geared how to predict behavior. With observation, we're looking for the unique and peculiar things that can inspire design. 
					        <br>
					        But observation is a really powerful and transferable skill.

					    <aside class="notes">
					        Last year I was involved in a project to develop the blueprint and business case for Australia's first Zero Net Energy Town in Uralla, NSW. We elected to use Human Centered Design as a broad framework (particularly for the lenses of Desirability, Feasible and Viable). 
					        <br>
					        Our whole team was from Melbourne and we went out to the town to conduct community engagement (activities, energy audits etc.), thinking that would be quite a comprehensive approach. Fortunately we got to stay with a local project director and it gave us extra time and budget to just hang out. And we learned alot about the town, its people, its culture, their behavior and what mattered to them.
					        <br>
					        Stuff like how the town used way more wood than we imagined really surprised us. And the grey economy where wood came from. The culture of the town and strength of community spirit we experienced in person.
